🔐 ClyvLock – Modern Full-Stack Password Manager

ClyvLock
 is my own take on a secure and user-friendly password manager, built using the MERN stack (React + Vite, Express.js, MongoDB) and styled with Tailwind CSS.

Right now, it stores passwords safely in the browser’s localStorage, but soon I’ll connect MongoDB for full cloud-based storage and syncing.

🚀 Tech Stack

Frontend: React + Vite, Tailwind CSS

Backend: Node.js + Express.js

Database: MongoDB with Mongoose (integration in progress)

Current Storage: Browser localStorage

✨ Key Features

➕ Add, ✏️ edit, ❌ delete passwords

📋 One-click copy to clipboard
